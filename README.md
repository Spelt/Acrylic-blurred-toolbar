# Acrylic-blurred-toolbar
Delphi Acrylic blur toolbar

This repository is an example of a blurred toolbar component for Delphi using Skia. It uses shaders and is very fast. Its based on a example from Jim mcKeeth.

This a basic source and not a component, at the moment you need to add your own package and include the source yourself.
